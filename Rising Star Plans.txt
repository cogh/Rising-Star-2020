Rising Star Notes
-----------------

General plans:
- Import TD models
- Create proper tile+OnTop child system for tiles
- Character actions
- Create enemies with pathfinding
- Building/Turret system
- Turret versions
- Create wave system
- Create game loop stuff (health, base, money)

Importing models:
- Will use Kenney assets
- Might need enemy models still

Tile+Ontop system for tiles:
- One base tile, then something ontop
- Object ontop could be harvestable/turret/nothing/solid
- Possibly "nothing" could be replaced with does_exist bool

Character actions:
- Actions are: move, build, harvest, upgrade
- Link coroutines together
- Move coroutine should link into action
- Action should be a parameter of move
- Make character stand on tile for now, add distance later
- Distance will apply to any solid. You can move next to a solid
- Start with only one type of building/turret

Enemies:
- One model at first
- Just make them follow the player
- Copy movement coroutine from player

Building/Turret system
- Start with just one model with set range/damage, no upgrades
- Constructing/Active bool
- Constructing takes time
- Array of versions/upgrades
- Just make it rotate to enemy for now, 2-part movement later

Turret versions:
- Cost, build time, damage, range, projectile model, fire rate
- Check next in array to determine cost/build time

Wave system:
- Probably controlled by Game, maybe sub object
- Waves have: Array of enemies, reward (coins), 
- Start with array of waves, later do generative endless

Game loop stuff:
- Variables for base health/money/wave/etc.
- Owned by Game
- Need communication between other objects to add money/etc.
